        <h1 style="color: #5581d4">Why did I picked IT as my course?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I’ve always been fascinated by technology – the solutions, entertainment and innovation it could 
            bring to people. What course I really wanted was Computer Engineering, but it wasn’t an available 
            course in the previous college I was enrolled in and BSIT was the only available Computer-related 
            course they had. I did quick research about this course and become intrigued about it, ultimately 
            deciding to take it. So, when I transferred in University of Cebu, I decided to continue this course 
            instead of shifting. I ended up having other several reasons why I chose this course after researching 
            about it.

        <ol>
            <li><h3>High demand for IT specialists:</h3></li>
            <p>
                One of the reasons why I picked it was because of the high demand for IT specialists are worldwide. 
                Technology has become one of the essentials used by businesses and people in their everyday lives. 
                As digitalization become globalized, the need for IT specialist increases and it became one of the 
                secure jobs in the work field. This course also offers a wide range of careers paths such as Software 
                Development, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Systems Administration, Networking, Web Development, AI, etc. 
                So as a BSIT student, I wouldn’t be limited to one career path once I graduated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Flexibility in Work Arrangements:</h3></li>
            <p>
                As an introvert and someone who prefers to work alone or at home, jobs in IT are flexible. Unlike traditional 
                work that requires physical presence, many jobs in IT field allow working remotely and with flexible schedules. 
                Skills in IT are transferrable to other countries, so it gives me an opportunity to work with people from other 
                countries remotely. These are job traits that are appealing to me. IT field is incredibly broad and flexible; I 
                could pick any specialization based on my strengths and interests without leaving the industry. I could learn more 
                than one career path if I wanted to which could make me versatile.
            </p>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Continously Learning and Adapting:</h3></li>
            <p>
                Technology constantly and quickly evolves as time went on. There’s always something new going on, new innovations or 
                news about it. IT teaches us practical skills like programming, systems management, or database handling while leaving 
                room for creativity in how those skills are applied. It’s challenging and makes me face problems more often. After all 
                IT isn’t just about coding, but also about solving problems and improving systems. This encourages me to have a critical 
                mind and be creative. IT also allows me to blend logic with creativity. So, despite having the same technical foundation, 
                you can still create different things.

            </p>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Entrepreneurship Opportunities:</h3></li>
            <p>
                IT also open the doors for starting your own business or becoming self-employed. There are low barriers to enter when you 
                start up your own business in IT field. It doesn’t require huge funding unlike other businesses, just a computer, good internet 
                connection and IT skills, you can start doing freelancing, developing your own apps or offering online IT services. Another 
                business opportunity you can create is a startup. Since IT field always strive for innovation, this motivates students to be 
                creative like launching software that can help solve real-life problems.

            These are the reasons why I picked IT as my course. I'm well aware that it's not as easy as I make it sound to be in my 
            explanation. I'll encounter problems and make mistakes but I'm willing to learn from them.
